## BOM

| Qty | Description | Price | Link | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|------| ----- |
| 1 | Raspberry Pi (4B / 5 / 3A+ / Zero 2W) | ~$25-80 | [Amazon](https://amzn.to/43yLDZJ) | [See note for 512 MB Pis](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/RPi0W2-Installation-Guide) |
| 1 | Micro SD Card (≥32 GB) | ~$10 | [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4eGy7te) | |
| 1 | USB lavalier microphone | $16.95 | [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4vLSaMK) | |
| 1 | Pi power supply | ~$10 | - | |

Optional: a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to restyle illustrations, an [eBird API key](https://ebird.org/api/keygen) to filter species by region.

### Kits

I offer the bird mic and the wall frame as separate electronics kits. I put up a store for some of my open-source projects and will soon be able to offer kits cheaper than buying all the components individually, once I start buying in bulk.

- [Bird mic kit](https://theodore.net/store/avian-mic/)
- [Frame kit](https://theodore.net/store/avian-visitors/)

---

## 1. Flash the SD card

Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/). Pick Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit). In the customisation dialog set:

- Username
- WiFi SSID + password
- Hostname: `birdnet`
- Enable SSH with password auth

Plug the USB mic into the Pi. Place the capsule in a window or mount it outside. Boot.

---

## 2. Run the installer

Installer assumes passwordless sudo (Raspberry Pi OS Lite default - if you've tightened it, run `sudo raspi-config` -> *System Options* -> restore the default first).

```bash
ssh <your-username>@birdnet.local
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/white111/AvianVisitors_Weather/avian-visitors/newinstaller.sh | bash
```

Clones this fork, installs BirdNET-Pi, symlinks the AvianVisitors overlay into the Caddy web root. Takes 20-40 minutes. Reboots when done.

Collage: `http://birdnet.local/`. Stock BirdNET-Pi UI: `http://birdnet.local/index.php`. The menu button in the top right opens an admin overlay with Settings, System, Logs, and Tools.

Stock BirdNET-Pi pages still render, but privileged legacy controls are not enabled. Use the Avian Visitors menu for the station controls it exposes, and SSH for remaining maintenance.

Optional Google Drive backups are set up under **Settings → Nightly Drive backup**. Local cleanup stays unavailable until an archive run has been verified.

### Local admin access

Optional password protection for local administrator controls can be enabled in **Settings**. Public bird pages remain available without signing in, while live audio is unavailable when protection is on.

If no password is configured, or the state is missing or invalid, recover it from an SSH session:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/avian-admin-control password-reset
```

The command prompts privately for a new password. Return to **Settings** after it finishes.

### Educators mode

Educators mode is an optional profile for the BirdNET-Pi website. It adds a fifth menu page for starting, pausing, organizing, and reviewing listening periods. Enable it after installation over SSH:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/avian-educators enable
```

New stations can also install with the profile enabled:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/white111/AvianVisitors_Weather/avian-visitors/newinstaller.sh | bash -s -- --educators
```

Listening periods scope the Collage, Stats, Atlas, and available detection clips without copying or protecting audio files from normal retention. Saved period and folder exports require a direct local connection. See [the Educators guide](docs/educators.md) for the full workflow and privacy details.

### Updating an existing station

For the first v1 update, or if an interrupted older update left the admin helper missing and Tools locked, keep the existing checkout and run this verified setup over SSH:

```bash
upgrade=$(mktemp "$HOME/avian-v1-upgrade.XXXXXX")
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/white111/AvianVisitors_Weather/avian-visitors/scripts/bootstrap_v1.sh -o "$upgrade"
sudo bash "$upgrade"
rm -f "$upgrade"
```

After v1, use **Tools → Pull latest** or run:

```bash
cd ~/BirdNET-Pi
./scripts/update_birdnet.sh
```

The updater preserves custom bird artwork, generated mask data, and existing credentials. It stops if other tracked files have local edits. It verifies and stages one official release before changing the checkout. If applying that release is interrupted, keep the new checkout and resume the same prepared installation without fetching another release:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/avian-service-refresh
```

If the installed refresher itself is missing or unsafe, use the verified setup command above. An already-running older updater cannot gain the new preparation checks until it has finished or been recovered this way. Only use `sudo /usr/local/sbin/avian-admin-control password-reset` for missing credentials after the helper is installed successfully.

## iPad display (including 1st-gen iPad Air)

Open `http://pibird.local/` in Safari on the iPad and use **Share → Add to Home Screen** for a full-screen wall display. On touch screens, tap a bird once to see its name and tap it again to open its postcard. A postcard closes itself after 30 seconds without a touch, and a quiet **1H** window switches to **12H** until a bird is heard again.

The 1st-gen iPad Air tops out at iOS 12 (Safari 12), which cannot read much of the modern CSS and a few of the browser APIs the collage uses. That browser automatically gets:

- `styles.legacy.css`, generated from `styles.css`. Rebuild it whenever `styles.css` changes, for example after syncing upstream:
  ```
  cd avian/scripts/legacy_css && npm ci && npm run build
  ```
- `compat.js`, small stand-ins for `Element.animate`, `replaceChildren` and pointer events.
- PNG copies of the nest artwork (Safari 12 has no WebP), and the classic Atlas cards instead of stamps.

Tablet sizing lives in `avian/frontend/ipad.css`, kept separate so upstream changes to `styles.css` merge cleanly.

## 3. (Optional) Restyle the illustrations

The repo ships with 666 bundled illustrations (333 species, perched + flight). To restyle them or generate a set for your own region:

```bash
pip install -r ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/requirements.txt
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-key'  # image generation requires billing enabled

# generate on a cream ground, cut the ground off, rebuild the collage masks
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/pregen.py --labels ~/BirdNET-Pi/model/labels.txt --force
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/cutout.py
python3 ~/BirdNET-Pi/avian/scripts/build_masks.py
```

On a Pi with 4 GB of RAM or less, add `--model u2net` to the `cutout.py` command; the default model may be [OOM-killed](https://github.com/Twarner491/AvianVisitors/issues/17).

Filter to your region with `--ebird-region US-CA` (needs `EBIRD_API_KEY`). The full pipeline, prompt, reference images, and per-species tuning live in [`avian/scripts/README.md`](avian/scripts/README.md). Style lives in [`prompt.template.md`](avian/scripts/prompt.template.md).

See [illustration bundles](illustration-bundles.md) for pregenerated bundles shared by other folks in the community, or share your own for others to use!

## 4. (Optional) Forward off your LAN

See [`avian/forwarding/`](avian/forwarding/) for three independent recipes:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** for a public HTTPS URL.
- **Home Assistant REST sensor** that exposes the latest detection.
- **MQTT bridge** that publishes every new detection.

## Repo layout

```
avian/                  # everything we add to BirdNET-Pi
├── frontend/           # static HTML/JS/CSS for the collage
├── assets/             # 666 bundled illustrations + photo-cutout fallbacks
├── api/                # PHP shims served by BirdNET-Pi's PHP-FPM
├── scripts/            # generate -> cutout -> masks pipeline + prompt
└── forwarding/         # optional HA / MQTT / Cloudflare configs
frame/                  # optional e-ink wall display
```

Everything outside `avian/` and `frame/` is upstream BirdNET-Pi.

---

## Wall frame

An optional e-ink frame puts the bird collage on a panel by your window. Build it from [`frame/`](frame/README.md). It can run off your own BirdNET mic, from BirdWeather around a ZIP code, or from one public BirdWeather station with `frame/install.sh --station-id <ID>`.
